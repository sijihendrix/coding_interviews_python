### Problem 1: Initialize a new list called a_list with the elements: ["item1", "Item2", "Item3" ]

### Problem2: Change the second element in b_list(defined below) to 1.

b_list = [0,0,0]

### Problem3: Iterate over each element in c_list and print it using the for element in syntax

c_list = ["a", "b", "c" ]

### Problem 4: Iterate over each d_list and print it using the for i in range(x) syntax

### Problem 5: Find the sum of e_list, which contains [32, 55, 712, 1]

### Actual list problem from coding interview: Given an array of integers: write a function that searches the arrray for the second largest element in the array
